# Star Trek Captains

## Overview

This assignment is a deliverable for [Code:You](https://code-you.org/)'s Software Development with C# pathway. I combined week 7 and week 8 requirements into this assignment.

###### Week 7

```
For this week, you will create a console application that does the following:

- Demonstrates understanding of material from previous modules.
- Accepts user input and stores it in a string variable.
- Implements try/catch to perform error handling.
- Uses the Parse() method to parse the user input in to a specific data type (like integer) and catches the exceptions thrown when that value cannot be parsed in to that data type.
```

###### Week 8

```
For this week, create a C# console application that does the following:

- Demonstrates previously learned material
- Defines a class with properties and methods.
- Creates instances of the class
- Calls at least one method on that class instance.
```

## To Run Locally

#### Required Tools to Run

| Tools                       |
| --------------------------- |
| .NET SDK                    |
| VS Code                     |
| C# Dev Kit VSCode Extension |

#### Instructions

1. Verify that you have the .NET SDK installed. To do this, run `dotnet --version` in GitBash. If a version number is not returned, you can [download the .NET SDK here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
2. Once you have verified that the .NET SDK is installed, open GitBash and `cd` into the directory of your choice.
3. Clone this repository by running `git clone https://github.com/dan-collins-dev/Star-Trek-Captains.git` in GitBash
4. `cd` into the cloned project and open it with VS Code
5. In VS Code's integrated terminal, run `dotnet build` followed by `dotnet run` to build and run the application.
